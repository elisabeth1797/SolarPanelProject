Our team developed a self-sustainable solar system with the following components:

# Dual-Axis Solar Tracking:
- Implemented dual-axis motion for precise sun tracking.
- Utilized two linear actuators to adjust the panelâ€™s orientation.
# Self-Cleaning Mechanism:
- Designed a mechanism to keep the solar panel clean.
- Ensured optimal energy capture by minimizing dirt and debris.
# Data App:
- Connected an app to the Arduino Mega microcontroller via Bluetooth.
- Displays real-time energy output from the solar panel.
- Enables users to monitor performance throughout the day.

The project aims to assess whether solar-tracking and self-cleaning enhance energy acquisition.
