# Solar-Tracking and Self-Cleaning Solar Panel Project
The team project aims to be a self-sustainable system that consists of dual-axis motion
for solar-tracking, a self-cleaning mechanism, and an app for data.The objective
is to determine whether the addition of the self-cleaning mechanism and solar-tracking improves the amount of energy acquired. Two linear actuators are
used to allow dual-axis motion. The system is controlled by an Arduino
Mega microcontroller board. Included with this project is also a self-cleaning
mechanism for the solar panel. There is also an app connected to the
microcontroller through bluetooth connection that will give the user useful
information. Energy being obtained by the panel will be displayed on the app.
This will allow the user to monitor how much energy is obtained by the panel at
different times of the day and whether the cleaning mechanism and solar-tracking improve the amount of energy acquired.
